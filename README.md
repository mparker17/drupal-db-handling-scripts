# drupal-db-handling-scripts

Scripts to standardize how a project handles database dumps; because if everyone does the same steps in the same order, it reduces unnecessary debugging confusion.

These scripts are designed to be put at `/scripts` and customized by the development lead as a Drupal project progresses.

These scripts assume [Drush version 8][drush8].
